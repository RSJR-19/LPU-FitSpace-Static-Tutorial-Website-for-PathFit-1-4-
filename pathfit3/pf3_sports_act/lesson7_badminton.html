          <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>
          <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across the net. This comprehensive

                <p>The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in Gloucestershire,
                  England,
                  where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China,
                  and India,
                  and it is closely related to the old children's game battledore and shuttlecock.</p>

                  tournament for women was arranged the next year.</p>

          <p>The easiest way to learn the forehand grip is to pretend you are shaking someone's hand.</p>

            <img src="/assets/images/pathfit3/Forehand.png">

          </ul>

          <h3>Backhand Grip</h3>
          <p>The easiest way to learn the backhand grip is to set up with your thumb on top of the wider section of the
            grip,
            with your strings facing the floor & ceiling like in the photo below. Your fingers should be relaxed around
            the side.</p>

          <p>Sixteen feathers fixed in a cork base enveloped in a thin leather sheet make a shuttlecock. Interestingly,
            the best Badminton Shuttlecocks are made from feathers from the wing of a goose. The shuttle weighs between

            although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only. The doubles court is wider than the

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Badminton Serve</h2>
          <p>There are 5 serving rules in badminton for both doubles and singles:</p>
          <h3>1. Both feet must be in contact with the floor when striking the shuttle.</h3>
          <div style="height: 300px;" class="image-placeholder">
            <img src="/assets/images/pathfit3/BadmintonServe.png">

            <img src="/assets/images/pathfit3/Fault.png">

            <img src="/assets/images/pathfit3/Cork.png">

            <img src="/assets/images/pathfit3/Height.png">
          </div>

          <h3>5. The serve must be delivered in a forward continuous motion.</h3>
          <p>Once you begin your backswing, the serve must be one continuous motion. At no point during the serving
            action can you pause.</p>
          <p>Examples of illegal serves under this rule include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stopping at the backswing and then moving forwards.</li>
            <li>Moving forwards and backwards multiple times before striking the shuttle.</li>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>BADMINTON RULES AND REGULATIONS</h2>
          <p>Badminton has many intricate rules and regulations. The Badminton World Federation has done a thorough job
            of compiling these
            rules and laying them out in an organized manner for you to learn. Check them out along with their
            vocabulary and simplified
            badminton rules below.</p>
          <p>Below are some basic rules you need to know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A match consists of the best of three games to 21 points</li><br>
            <li>Every time there is a serve, one point is scored</li><br>
            <li>If the score is 20-20, the individual or team must win by two points to win the game</li><br>
            <li>In terms of serving, at the beginning of the game when the score is 0-0 or if the server’s score is
              even, they will serve
              from the right service court. However, when the server’s score is odd, they will serve from the left
              service court.</li><br>
            <li>The rally is over once the birdie contacts the floor, does not return over the net, or lands outside the
              court lines.</li><br>

            <h2>BADMINTON OFFICIALS</h2>
            <p>There are three types of officials in the sport of Badminton.</p>
            <h3>1. Referee</h3>
            <p>The Referee takes responsibility for making sure the tournament is run according to all the rules, is
              fair and that
              sportsmanship is being upheld.</p>
            <h3>2. Umpire</h3>
            <p>The Umpire takes responsibility for running individual matches. He or she is responsible for making all
              final decisions
              for points awarded in a match.</p>
            <h3>3. Linesman</h3>
            <p>Linesmen take responsibility for making line calls on shuttles that land on the floor of the badminton
              court.
              They are there to assist the umpire in making the best decision possible. Linesmen are not mandatory for
              any provincial
              tournaments, but are frequently used in more important matches.</p>
