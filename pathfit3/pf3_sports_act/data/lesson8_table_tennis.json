    "question": "Swimming is a low-impact exercise, yet it's highly effective for muscle development. According to the lesson, what property of water supports this high effectiveness without the impact forces of land-based exercise?",
    "options": [
      "The water temperature cools the muscles",
      "Swimming is a full-body workout",
      "The rhythmic nature of swimming reduces stress",
      "Water is about 800 times denser than air, providing greater resistance"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The lesson notes that water is about 800 times denser than air, which provides greater resistance for muscle development without the high-impact forces of land-based exercise."

    "question": "What is identified in the Acclimation Techniques section as the essential skill for basic Breathing Control?",
    "options": [
      "Holding your breath for as long as possible",
      "Taking fast, shallow breaths above the surface",
      "Exhaling underwater (blowing bubbles) and rhythmic breathing",
      "Only breathing out when turning your head to the side"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The lesson lists Breathing Control as an acclimation technique, defined specifically as 'Exhaling underwater (blowing bubbles) and rhythmic breathing.'"

    "question": "Which Key Movement Principle involves achieving an optimal, hydrodynamic body shape for maximum efficiency and minimal effort in the water?",
    "options": [
      "Propulsion",
      "Treading Water",
      "Rhythm and Timing",
      "Streamline"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Streamline is defined as achieving an optimal, hydrodynamic body shape for efficiency, which is key to moving through the water with minimal effort."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary mechanical reason, mentioned in the Key Movement Principles, for keeping the body flat and near the surface of the water?",
    "options": [
      "To make it easier to tread water",
      "To facilitate better sculling (hand movements)",
      "To help keep the lungs full of air",
      "To reduce drag"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The lesson states that Body Position involves 'Keeping the body flat and near the surface of the water to reduce drag,' which ensures efficient movement."
  },
  {
    "question": "The lesson emphasizes the ability to float as a fundamental skill. What specific technique is listed as the key to buoyancy while performing the 'Starfish Float'?",
    "options": [
      "Tensing the abdominal muscles",
      "Focusing on slow, deep breaths to help keep your lungs full of air",
      "Using continuous, small hand movements (sculling)",
      "Keeping your head completely out of the water"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The Practical Application: Mastering the Float section advises to 'Focus on slow, deep breaths to help keep your lungs full of air, which is the key to buoyancy.'"
