    "question": "What distinguishes Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) from other eating disorders?",
    "options": [
      "It is caused by binge eating episodes",
      "It involves disturbed eating due to sensory sensitivities or lack of interest in food",
      "It always occurs with extreme body weight changes",
      "It only affects adults"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "ARFID is unique because it is not driven by body image concerns. Individuals avoid or restrict food due to sensory issues like taste, texture, smell, or temperature, or simply due to lack of interest in eating. Unlike anorexia or bulimia, ARFID is rooted in sensory or behavioral responses to food."
