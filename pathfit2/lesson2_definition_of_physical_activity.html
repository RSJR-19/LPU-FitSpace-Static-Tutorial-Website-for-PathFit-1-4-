          <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
          <p>Physical activity encompasses any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy
            expenditure. Understanding what constitutes physical activity is crucial for developing a comprehensive
            approach to fitness and health.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Main Content -->
        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Understanding Physical Activity</h2>
          <p>Physical activity includes all forms of movement that burn calories and engage our muscles. This can range
            from daily activities like walking and housework to structured exercise and competitive sports. The key distinction is that physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure above resting levels.</p>

          <p>Unlike exercise (which is planned, structured, and repetitive), physical activity encompasses everything from taking the stairs to playing basketball with friends. Understanding the different types and intensities helps you make informed choices about how to incorporate more movement into your daily life.</p>

          <div class="components-grid">
            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Types of Physical Activity</h3>
              <p>Physical activity can be categorized based on the context in which it occurs:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily Activities (Lifestyle Activities)</strong> - These are movements you do as part of your regular routine, such as walking to class, taking the stairs, cleaning your room, gardening, or doing household chores. These activities don't require special equipment or a gym membership, but they add up throughout the day and contribute significantly to your overall activity level. Examples include: walking to the store, vacuuming, raking leaves, washing dishes, or playing with pets.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupational Activities</strong> - These are physical activities performed as part of your job or work. People with physically demanding jobs (like construction workers, nurses, or delivery personnel) naturally get more physical activity during work hours. However, even office workers can increase occupational activity by using standing desks, taking walking meetings, or using a desk bike. The key is finding ways to move more during work hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Recreational Activities</strong> - These are activities you do for fun, enjoyment, or leisure. They include sports (basketball, volleyball, badminton), dance classes, hiking, swimming, playing frisbee, or any activity that gets you moving while having fun. Recreational activities are particularly beneficial because they're enjoyable, which makes it easier to stick with them long-term. They also often involve social interaction, which adds to their appeal.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Exercise</strong> - This refers to planned, repetitive physical activity designed to improve or maintain fitness. Examples include going to the gym, attending fitness classes (yoga, Zumba, spinning), following a workout video, or doing a home exercise routine. Structured exercise is typically more intense and goal-oriented than daily activities, but both are important for overall health.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Activity Intensity Levels</h3>
              <p>Intensity refers to how hard your body is working during physical activity. Understanding intensity helps you ensure you're getting the right amount of activity for your fitness goals.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Light Intensity</strong> - At this level, you can easily carry on a conversation and your breathing is only slightly elevated. Your heart rate increases slightly, but you're not breaking a sweat. Examples include: casual walking (strolling), gentle stretching, light housework, slow dancing, or leisurely bike riding. While light activity is better than being sedentary, it may not provide all the cardiovascular benefits of moderate or vigorous activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate Intensity</strong> - At this level, you're working hard enough that your heart rate is noticeably elevated, you're breathing harder, and you can still talk but not sing. You should be able to feel that you're exercising, but it shouldn't be so difficult that you can't maintain it for at least 10 minutes. Examples include: brisk walking (3-4 mph), cycling at a moderate pace, water aerobics, doubles tennis, or pushing a lawn mower. The "talk test" is a simple way to gauge moderate intensity - you should be able to speak in short sentences but not comfortably carry on a long conversation.</li>
                <li><strong>Vigorous Intensity</strong> - At this level, your heart rate is significantly elevated, you're breathing hard and fast, and you can only say a few words at a time before needing to catch your breath. You're definitely sweating and working hard. Examples include: running, fast cycling, swimming laps, singles tennis, jumping rope, or high-intensity sports. Vigorous activity provides the same health benefits as moderate activity but in less time - 1 minute of vigorous activity equals about 2 minutes of moderate activity.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Intensity (Maximum Effort)</strong> - This is near your maximum capacity - very short bursts of all-out effort that you can only maintain for seconds to a minute. Examples include: sprinting at full speed, heavy weightlifting, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercises. This level is typically used for athletic training or advanced fitness programs and should be approached with caution, especially for beginners.</li>
