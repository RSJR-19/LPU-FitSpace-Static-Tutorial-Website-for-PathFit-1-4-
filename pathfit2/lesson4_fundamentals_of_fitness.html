          <h2>Core Principles of Fitness</h2>
          <p>Understanding the fundamental principles of fitness is crucial for developing an effective exercise program. These principles are based on scientific research and decades of experience in exercise physiology. They guide how you should structure your workouts, progress over time, and achieve optimal results safely and efficiently.</p>

          <p>These principles apply to everyone, from beginners to elite athletes. By understanding and applying them, you can create a fitness program that is safe, effective, and tailored to your individual needs and goals.</p>

          <div class="components-grid">
            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Training Principles</h3>
              <p>These are the fundamental rules that govern how your body adapts to exercise:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Overload Principle</strong> - This is the foundation of all fitness improvement. To get stronger, faster, or more fit, you must challenge your body beyond its current capacity. Your body adapts to the stress placed upon it. If you always do the same workout at the same intensity, your body will adapt to that level and stop improving. Overload can be achieved by increasing weight, repetitions, duration, intensity, or frequency. For example, if you can do 10 push-ups easily, you need to do 11 or 12, or add weight, to continue improving. However, overload must be applied gradually and appropriately - too much too soon leads to injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Progression Principle</strong> - This principle states that overload should be increased gradually over time. You can't go from doing 10 push-ups to 50 overnight. Progression means systematically increasing the demands on your body as it adapts. A common progression pattern is to increase intensity or volume by about 5-10% per week. For example, if you're running 3 miles this week, next week you might run 3.2 miles, or run the same 3 miles slightly faster. Progression should be steady but not rushed - your body needs time to adapt to each new level of stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Specificity Principle</strong> - This principle states that your body adapts specifically to the type of training you do. If you want to improve your running, you need to run. If you want to get stronger, you need to lift weights. The adaptations you get are specific to the muscles used, the energy systems trained, and the movement patterns practiced. This is why a cyclist might be great on a bike but struggle with running - the training is specific. To achieve your goals, your training must match what you want to improve. This doesn't mean you should only do one thing, but rather that your primary training should align with your primary goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Reversibility Principle (Use It or Lose It)</strong> - This principle states that fitness gains are reversible - if you stop training, you'll lose the adaptations you've gained. This is often called "detraining." The good news is that you typically lose fitness more slowly than you gain it. However, after about 2 weeks of inactivity, you'll start to see declines in cardiovascular fitness. After 4-6 weeks, you'll notice significant decreases in strength and endurance. The rate of loss depends on how fit you were and how long you've been inactive. The key takeaway: consistency is crucial. It's better to do a little exercise regularly than a lot occasionally.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Differences Principle</strong> - This principle recognizes that everyone responds differently to exercise. Factors like genetics, age, gender, training history, nutrition, sleep, and stress all influence how quickly and how much you adapt to training. Some people gain strength quickly, others improve endurance faster. Some recover quickly between workouts, others need more rest. This is why it's important not to compare yourself to others and why personalized programs work better than one-size-fits-all approaches. Pay attention to how your body responds and adjust your program accordingly.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Program Variables (FITT-VP)</h3>
              <p>These are the specific factors you can manipulate to create an effective training program:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency</strong> - This refers to how often you train. For cardiovascular fitness, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends 3-5 days per week. For strength training, 2-3 days per week is typically sufficient, allowing for recovery between sessions. Frequency depends on your goals, fitness level, and available time. Beginners might start with 2-3 days per week, while more advanced individuals might train 5-6 days. The key is finding a frequency you can maintain consistently. More isn't always better - adequate rest is essential for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Intensity</strong> - This is how hard you work during exercise. For cardiovascular exercise, intensity is often measured as a percentage of maximum heart rate (50-85% for most training) or using the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. For strength training, intensity refers to the percentage of your one-rep maximum (1RM) or how heavy the weight feels. Intensity is crucial because it determines the adaptations you'll get. Low intensity improves endurance, moderate intensity improves general fitness, and high intensity improves power and speed. However, not every workout should be high intensity - variety is important for recovery and preventing overtraining.</li>
                <li><strong>Time (Duration)</strong> - This is how long each exercise session lasts. For cardiovascular exercise, recommendations are typically 20-60 minutes of continuous activity, or you can accumulate time throughout the day in 10-minute bouts. For strength training, sessions typically last 30-60 minutes depending on the number of exercises and sets. Duration should be appropriate for your fitness level and goals. Beginners might start with shorter durations and gradually increase. The key is that duration and intensity have an inverse relationship - if you increase intensity, you might need to decrease duration, and vice versa.</li>
                <li><strong>Type (Mode)</strong> - This refers to the kind of exercise you do. For cardiovascular fitness, you can choose from activities like running, cycling, swimming, dancing, or rowing. For strength training, you might use free weights, machines, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. The type of exercise should match your goals, preferences, available equipment, and any physical limitations. Variety in exercise type can help prevent boredom and overuse injuries. It's also important to choose activities you enjoy, as this increases adherence to your program.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume</strong> - This is the total amount of work performed. For cardiovascular exercise, volume might be measured in total distance (e.g., miles run per week) or total time. For strength training, volume is often calculated as sets × repetitions × weight. Volume is important because it contributes to the overall training stimulus. However, volume and intensity must be balanced - you can't do high volume and high intensity simultaneously without risking overtraining. Generally, as intensity increases, volume should decrease, and vice versa.</li>
                <li><strong>Progression</strong> - While progression is also a principle, it's also a variable you can manipulate. This refers to how you advance your program over time. Progression can be linear (gradual increases), undulating (varying intensity/volume throughout the week), or periodized (structured phases of training). The rate of progression should match your adaptation rate - beginners can progress faster than advanced trainees. Progression should be planned and systematic, not random.</li>
