                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Understanding FITT Components</h2>
                    <p>The FITT Principle is a framework that helps you design effective exercise programs by considering four key variables. Understanding each component and how they work together is essential for creating workouts that will help you achieve your fitness goals safely and efficiently.</p>

                    <div class="components-grid">
                        <div class="component-box">
                            <h3>Frequency</h3>
                            <p>Frequency refers to how often you exercise. This is typically measured in sessions per week.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>How Often to Exercise</strong> - The recommended frequency depends on your fitness goals and the type of exercise. For cardiovascular fitness, aim for 3-5 days per week. For strength training, 2-3 days per week is typically sufficient, allowing for recovery between sessions. Beginners might start with 2-3 days per week of any exercise, while more advanced individuals might exercise 5-6 days per week. The key is consistency - it's better to exercise 3 days per week consistently than to exercise 6 days one week and 0 days the next.</li>
                                <li><strong>Weekly Workout Schedule</strong> - Planning your weekly schedule helps ensure you're getting adequate exercise while allowing for proper recovery. A balanced week might include: Monday (strength), Tuesday (cardio), Wednesday (rest or light activity), Thursday (strength), Friday (cardio), Saturday (flexibility/active recovery), Sunday (rest). The schedule should fit your lifestyle and be sustainable long-term. Write it down or put it in your calendar to increase adherence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rest Day Planning</strong> - Rest days are crucial for recovery and adaptation. Your body doesn't get stronger during exercise - it gets stronger during rest when it repairs and adapts. Plan at least 1-2 complete rest days per week, or more if you're a beginner or doing very intense training. Active recovery (light activity like walking or stretching) can be done on rest days and may actually help recovery. Listen to your body - if you're excessively tired or sore, take an extra rest day.</li>
                                <li><strong>Activity Distribution</strong> - How you distribute your activities throughout the week matters. For strength training, you typically want at least one day of rest between sessions for the same muscle groups (e.g., don't do upper body strength training two days in a row). For cardiovascular exercise, you can do it more frequently, but still allow for some recovery. Mixing different types of activities throughout the week (cross-training) helps prevent overuse injuries and keeps workouts interesting.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="component-box">
                            <h3>Intensity</h3>
                            <p>Intensity refers to how hard you work during exercise. This is one of the most important variables because it determines the adaptations you'll get.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>How Hard to Work</strong> - Intensity can be measured in different ways depending on the type of exercise. For cardiovascular exercise, intensity is often measured as a percentage of your maximum heart rate (MHR). The formula is: MHR = 220 - your age. Moderate intensity is 50-70% of MHR, and vigorous intensity is 70-85% of MHR. For strength training, intensity refers to the percentage of your one-rep maximum (1RM) or how heavy the weight feels. Generally, 60-80% of 1RM is used for building strength and muscle size.</li>
                                <li><strong>Heart Rate Zones</strong> - Understanding heart rate zones helps you train at the right intensity. Zone 1 (50-60% MHR) is for warm-up and recovery. Zone 2 (60-70% MHR) is moderate intensity, good for building aerobic base and burning fat. Zone 3 (70-80% MHR) is vigorous intensity, improving cardiovascular fitness. Zone 4 (80-90% MHR) is very hard, improving anaerobic capacity. Zone 5 (90-100% MHR) is maximum effort, only sustainable for short bursts. Most of your training should be in zones 2-3 for general fitness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Perceived Exertion (RPE Scale)</strong> - The Rate of Perceived Exertion scale is a simple way to gauge intensity without equipment. On a scale of 1-10: 1-2 is very light (like walking slowly), 3-4 is light, 5-6 is moderate (you can talk but not sing), 7-8 is vigorous (can only say a few words), 9 is very hard, and 10 is maximum effort. The "talk test" is another simple method: if you can easily carry on a conversation, you're at light intensity. If you can talk but not sing, you're at moderate intensity. If you can only say a few words, you're at vigorous intensity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resistance Levels</strong> - For strength training, intensity is determined by how much weight you lift relative to your maximum. Beginners might start at 50-60% of their 1RM, while more advanced trainees might work at 70-85% of 1RM. The weight should be challenging enough that you can complete your target repetitions with good form, but the last 1-2 reps should be difficult. If you can easily do more reps than planned, the weight is too light. If you can't complete the planned reps, the weight is too heavy.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Time (Duration)</h3>
                            <p>Time refers to how long each exercise session lasts. Duration should be appropriate for your fitness level and goals.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Duration of Exercise</strong> - For cardiovascular exercise, recommendations are typically 20-60 minutes of continuous activity, or you can accumulate time in 10-minute bouts throughout the day. Beginners might start with 10-15 minutes and gradually increase. For strength training, sessions typically last 30-60 minutes, depending on the number of exercises and sets. A full-body strength workout might take 45-60 minutes, while a split routine (focusing on specific muscle groups) might take 30-45 minutes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Session Length</strong> - The total length of your workout session includes warm-up, main exercise, and cool-down. A typical session might be: 5-10 minute warm-up, 20-45 minutes of main exercise, and 5-10 minute cool-down, totaling 30-65 minutes. The main exercise portion is what counts toward your weekly exercise goals. Don't skip warm-up and cool-down - they're important for injury prevention and recovery.</li>
                                <li><strong>Work Intervals</strong> - In interval training, you alternate between periods of high-intensity work and recovery. Work intervals might be 30 seconds to 5 minutes, depending on your fitness level and goals. Shorter intervals (30 seconds to 1 minute) are typically very high intensity, while longer intervals (3-5 minutes) are moderate to high intensity. Interval training is time-efficient and can provide similar or greater benefits than longer continuous exercise.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recovery Periods</strong> - Recovery periods are the rest times between exercises or intervals. For strength training, recovery between sets is typically 30 seconds to 3 minutes, depending on the intensity and your goals. Shorter rest (30-60 seconds) increases muscular endurance, while longer rest (2-3 minutes) allows for maximum strength development. For interval training, recovery periods are typically equal to or slightly longer than work intervals. Active recovery (light movement) is often better than complete rest for cardiovascular intervals.</li>

                                <li><strong>Mode of Exercise</strong> - The mode is the specific activity you choose. For cardiovascular fitness, you can choose from activities like running, cycling, swimming, rowing, dancing, or using cardio machines. For strength training, you might use free weights, machines, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. The mode should be something you enjoy and can do consistently. If you hate running, don't force yourself to run - choose an activity you'll actually do.</li>
                                <li><strong>Activity Selection</strong> - Select activities that align with your goals. If your goal is to improve running performance, running should be your primary mode. If your goal is general fitness, you can choose any mode you enjoy. Consider your physical limitations - if you have joint problems, low-impact activities like swimming or cycling might be better than running. Also consider available equipment and facilities - you don't need a gym to get fit, but access to equipment can provide more variety.</li>
                                <li><strong>Exercise Variety</strong> - While consistency in your primary mode is important, variety has benefits too. Cross-training (doing different types of activities) helps prevent overuse injuries, reduces boredom, and ensures you're developing all fitness components. For example, a runner might also do strength training, yoga, and cycling. Variety also helps prevent plateaus - changing your routine challenges your body in new ways, promoting continued adaptation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Equipment Choices</strong> - The equipment you use affects the type of exercise you can do. Free weights (dumbbells, barbells) allow for more natural movement patterns and require more stabilization. Machines provide more support and are easier for beginners. Resistance bands are portable and versatile. Bodyweight exercises require no equipment and can be done anywhere. Your choice should consider your goals, experience level, available resources, and preferences. Many effective workouts can be done with minimal or no equipment.</li>
