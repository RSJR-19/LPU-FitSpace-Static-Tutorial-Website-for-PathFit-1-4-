    "question": "Which fundamental principle requires gradually increasing training load to continue improving fitness?",
    "options": [
      "Progression",
      "Regression",
      "Reversibility",
      "Randomization"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The principle of progression requires gradually increasing exercise load (intensity, duration, frequency) to maintain fitness improvements and prevent plateaus."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does the principle of specificity in training mean?",
    "options": [
      "Training must specifically target the fitness components you want to improve",
      "You should do the same workout every day",
      "Training should only be done in specific locations",
      "You need specific equipment to train"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Specificity means that training adaptations are specific to the type of training performed. If you want to improve cardiovascular endurance, you must do aerobic training."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which principle states that fitness improvements stop if training stimulus is removed?",
    "options": [
      "Progression",
      "Overload",
      "Reversibility",
      "Adaptation"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Reversibility means that physical fitness improvements are reversible. If you stop training, you will lose fitness gains over time."
  },
  {
    "question": "The principle of overload requires that you:",
    "options": [
      "Increase training demands beyond the normal level",
      "Do the minimum amount of exercise",
      "Avoid challenging yourself",
      "Never change your routine"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Overload means systematically increasing training demands (by increasing intensity, duration, or frequency) to continuously challenge the body and promote adaptation."
  },
  {
    "question": "True or False: Individual differences mean that all people respond to training in the same way.",
    "options": [
      "True",
      "False"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Individual differences mean that people respond differently to the same training stimulus due to genetics, age, fitness level, and other factors. Programs should be individualized."
