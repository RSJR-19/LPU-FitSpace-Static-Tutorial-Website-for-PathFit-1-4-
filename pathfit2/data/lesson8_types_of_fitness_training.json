    "question": "Which training type primarily improves cardiovascular endurance?",
    "options": [
      "Aerobic training (running, cycling, swimming)",
      "Static stretching",
      "Isometric holds",
      "Plyometrics"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Aerobic training uses oxygen to produce energy and improves heart and lung function. Examples include running, cycling, and swimming."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary focus of anaerobic training?",
    "options": [
      "High-intensity efforts lasting seconds to minutes without oxygen",
      "Long, steady-paced activities",
      "Flexibility improvement",
      "Balance and coordination"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Anaerobic training involves high-intensity efforts (sprints, weightlifting) that work without sufficient oxygen, building power and strength."

  {
    "question": "Which training type uses resistance to build muscle strength and size?",
    "options": [
      "Resistance or strength training",
      "Aerobic training",
      "Flexibility training",
      "Balance training"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Resistance training uses weights, bands, or bodyweight to create muscle tension, leading to increased strength and muscle development."

  {
    "question": "Which training type is most effective for improving range of motion and reducing stiffness?",
    "options": [
      "Flexibility training (stretching)",
      "Aerobic training",
      "Strength training",
      "Power training"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Flexibility training using various stretching techniques improves range of motion, reduces muscle stiffness, and helps prevent injuries."
