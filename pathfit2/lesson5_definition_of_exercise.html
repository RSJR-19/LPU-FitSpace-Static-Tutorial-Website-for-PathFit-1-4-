          <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
          <p>Exercise is a planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity designed to maintain or improve one or
            more components of physical fitness. Unlike general physical activity, exercise is purposeful and
            goal-oriented movement that follows specific principles and guidelines.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Exercise</h2>
          <p>Exercise is a specific type of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and performed with the intention of improving or maintaining one or more components of physical fitness. While all exercise is physical activity, not all physical activity is exercise. The key difference is intentionality and structure - exercise is done with a specific fitness goal in mind, while physical activity can be any movement.</p>

          <p>For example, walking to class is physical activity, but going for a 30-minute brisk walk with the goal of improving cardiovascular fitness is exercise. Both are beneficial, but exercise provides more targeted and measurable fitness improvements.</p>

          <div class="components-grid">
            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Characteristics of Exercise</h3>
              <p>Exercise has specific characteristics that distinguish it from general physical activity:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Planned and Structured</strong> - Exercise is not random movement. It involves a predetermined plan that specifies what activities you'll do, in what order, for how long, and at what intensity. For example, a structured workout might include: 5-minute warm-up, 20 minutes of strength training (3 sets of 8 exercises), 10 minutes of cardio, and 5-minute cool-down. This structure ensures you're targeting specific fitness components and allows for progression over time. Without structure, it's difficult to track progress or ensure you're working all necessary components.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-Oriented</strong> - Exercise is performed with specific fitness goals in mind. These goals might be to improve cardiovascular endurance, build muscle strength, increase flexibility, lose weight, or prepare for a specific event. The exercises chosen and how they're performed should align with these goals. For instance, if your goal is to run a 5K, your exercise program should include running-specific training. If your goal is to build upper body strength, you'll focus on upper body resistance exercises. Having clear goals helps you select appropriate exercises and measure progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive</strong> - Effective exercise programs gradually increase in difficulty over time. This progression is what causes your body to adapt and improve. You might start with lighter weights and fewer repetitions, then gradually increase as you get stronger. Or you might start running 1 mile and gradually increase to 3 miles. Without progression, your body adapts to the current level and stops improving. Progression should be gradual (typically 5-10% increases) to allow for adaptation and prevent injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurable</strong> - Exercise involves quantifiable parameters that can be tracked. You can measure the weight lifted, distance run, time spent exercising, heart rate achieved, number of repetitions completed, or calories burned. This measurability allows you to track progress objectively. For example, you can see that you've progressed from lifting 50 pounds to 60 pounds, or from running 2 miles in 20 minutes to running 3 miles in 24 minutes. Measurement helps you know if your program is working and when to progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeatable</strong> - Exercise involves performing the same or similar activities on a regular basis. This repetition is what creates the training stimulus that leads to adaptation. You might do the same strength training routine 2-3 times per week, or follow a consistent running schedule. The repeatability allows you to track progress (you can compare this week's performance to last week's) and ensures you're providing consistent stimulus for improvement. However, some variation is also important to prevent boredom and overuse injuries.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Exercise Categories</h3>
              <p>Exercise can be categorized based on the primary fitness component it targets:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Aerobic Exercise (Cardiovascular Exercise)</strong> - This type of exercise improves the efficiency of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. It involves continuous, rhythmic movements of large muscle groups that increase your heart rate and breathing for an extended period (typically 20+ minutes). Examples include: running, jogging, brisk walking, cycling, swimming, dancing, rowing, and using cardio machines like ellipticals or stair climbers. Aerobic exercise primarily uses oxygen to produce energy and improves cardiovascular endurance. It's typically performed at moderate to vigorous intensity and can be done continuously or in intervals. Regular aerobic exercise strengthens your heart, improves lung function, increases stamina, and helps with weight management.</li>
                <li><strong>Strength Training (Resistance Training)</strong> - This type of exercise uses resistance (weights, resistance bands, bodyweight, or machines) to build muscular strength, endurance, and size. It involves performing exercises that target specific muscle groups through controlled movements. Examples include: lifting weights, using resistance bands, bodyweight exercises (push-ups, pull-ups, squats), and using weight machines. Strength training causes microscopic damage to muscle fibers, which then repair and grow stronger. It improves bone density, increases metabolism, enhances functional capacity, and helps prevent age-related muscle loss. Strength training should be performed 2-3 times per week, allowing at least one day of rest between sessions for the same muscle groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility Work</strong> - This type of exercise improves the range of motion in your joints and the length of your muscles. It involves stretching exercises that can be static (holding a stretch) or dynamic (moving through a range of motion). Examples include: static stretching, yoga, Pilates, dynamic stretching, and mobility exercises. Flexibility work helps prevent injuries, improves posture, reduces muscle tension, and enhances performance in other activities. It's best performed when muscles are warm (after a workout or warm-up) and should be done regularly (ideally daily) for best results. Flexibility improvements come slowly and require consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance Training</strong> - This type of exercise improves your ability to maintain stability and control your body's position. It's particularly important as we age to prevent falls. Examples include: standing on one leg, using balance boards or stability balls, yoga poses that challenge balance, tai chi, and exercises on unstable surfaces. Balance training improves proprioception (your body's awareness of its position in space), strengthens stabilizing muscles, and enhances coordination. It can be incorporated into other workouts or done as a separate session. Balance exercises should be progressive, starting with stable surfaces and simple movements, then progressing to more challenging positions.</li>
                <li><strong>Sports-Specific Training</strong> - This type of exercise is designed to improve performance in a specific sport or activity. It combines elements of other exercise types but focuses on movements, energy systems, and skills specific to the sport. For example, a basketball player might do agility drills, vertical jump training, and sport-specific conditioning. A swimmer might do dry-land strength training that mimics swimming movements, plus cardiovascular training. Sports-specific training improves the skills, movements, and fitness components most important for that particular activity. It often includes skill practice, conditioning, and strength training tailored to the sport's demands.</li>
