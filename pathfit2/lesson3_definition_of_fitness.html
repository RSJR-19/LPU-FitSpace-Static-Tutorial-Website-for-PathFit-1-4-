          <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
          <p>Fitness is a comprehensive state of well-being that encompasses physical, mental, and social dimensions.
            This lesson explores how fitness extends beyond mere physical capabilities to include overall health and
            performance in daily life.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Fitness</h2>
          <p>Fitness is a holistic concept that reflects an individual's ability to meet the demands of their
            environment while maintaining optimal health and well-being. It includes various aspects of human
            performance and health maintenance. Unlike physical fitness (which focuses on the body's physical capabilities), 
            overall fitness encompasses physical, mental, emotional, social, and even environmental dimensions.</p>

          <p>True fitness means having the capacity to handle life's challenges - whether that's climbing stairs without getting winded, managing stress effectively, maintaining positive relationships, or adapting to changes in your environment. It's about being prepared for whatever life throws at you, both physically and mentally.</p>

          <div class="components-grid">
            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Dimensions of Fitness</h3>
              <p>Fitness is multidimensional, meaning it involves multiple interconnected aspects of your well-being:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Fitness</strong> - This is what most people think of when they hear "fitness." It includes cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition. Physical fitness allows you to perform daily tasks efficiently, participate in recreational activities, and maintain independence as you age. It's the foundation that supports all other dimensions of fitness.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Fitness</strong> - This refers to the health and performance of your brain and cognitive functions. It includes memory, focus, problem-solving abilities, learning capacity, and mental clarity. Mental fitness can be improved through activities that challenge your brain (like learning new skills, reading, puzzles), as well as through physical exercise, which increases blood flow to the brain and promotes the growth of new brain cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional Fitness</strong> - This is your ability to recognize, understand, manage, and express your emotions in healthy ways. Emotionally fit people can handle stress, bounce back from setbacks, maintain positive relationships, and experience a full range of emotions without being overwhelmed. Emotional fitness involves self-awareness, emotional regulation, empathy, and resilience. Activities like meditation, journaling, therapy, and social connection can improve emotional fitness.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Fitness</strong> - This dimension relates to your ability to form and maintain healthy relationships, communicate effectively, work in teams, and contribute to your community. Socially fit individuals have strong support networks, can navigate social situations comfortably, and feel connected to others. Social fitness is developed through regular social interaction, participation in group activities, volunteering, and maintaining friendships and family relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Fitness</strong> - This newer dimension recognizes that fitness also involves your relationship with and adaptation to your environment. It includes your ability to function well in different physical environments (hot, cold, high altitude), your awareness of environmental factors that affect health (air quality, access to green spaces), and your ability to adapt to environmental changes. This dimension emphasizes that fitness isn't just about the individual, but about how well you interact with your surroundings.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Indicators of Fitness</h3>
              <p>You can assess your overall fitness level by observing these key indicators:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Levels</strong> - Fit individuals typically have consistent, sustainable energy throughout the day. They wake up feeling refreshed, can get through daily activities without excessive fatigue, and still have energy for recreational activities. If you find yourself constantly tired despite adequate sleep, it may indicate areas of fitness that need improvement. Good energy levels suggest that your body systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic) are functioning efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Capacity</strong> - This refers to your ability to perform physical tasks effectively. Can you carry groceries, climb stairs, play sports, or engage in recreational activities without becoming exhausted? Your performance capacity reflects the integration of all fitness components - strength, endurance, flexibility, and skill. As your fitness improves, you'll notice you can do more activities with less effort and recover more quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Ability</strong> - Fit people recover more quickly from physical exertion, stress, illness, or injury. After a workout, they bounce back faster. After a stressful day, they can relax and recharge more effectively. After being sick, they return to normal function sooner. Good recovery indicates that your body's systems are resilient and well-conditioned. Recovery involves proper rest, nutrition, hydration, and stress management.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress Management</strong> - Fitness helps you handle both physical and psychological stress better. Physically fit individuals have lower resting heart rates and blood pressure, which means their bodies are less reactive to stressors. Mentally and emotionally fit people have better coping strategies and can maintain perspective during challenging times. They can recognize stress, understand its sources, and take appropriate action to manage it rather than being overwhelmed.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability</strong> - This is your ability to adjust to changes in your environment, routine, or circumstances. Fit individuals can adapt to new physical challenges, changes in schedule, different environments, or unexpected situations. This adaptability comes from having a strong foundation in all dimensions of fitness - when one area is challenged, other areas can compensate. For example, if you can't go to the gym, you can adapt by doing home workouts. If you face emotional challenges, your physical fitness and social support help you cope.</li>
