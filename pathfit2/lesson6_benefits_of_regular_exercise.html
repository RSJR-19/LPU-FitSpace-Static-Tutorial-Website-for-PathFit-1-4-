      <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
      <p>Regular physical activity offers many benefits for the body and mind. This lesson summarizes the major
         physical, mental, and social benefits of exercise, recommended activity guidelines, and practical tips
         to include exercise in daily life.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Main Content -->
    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Physical Health Benefits</h2>
      <p>Regular exercise provides extensive physical health benefits that affect virtually every system in your body. These benefits occur through various physiological adaptations that happen when you consistently challenge your body through physical activity.</p>
      
      <div class="components-grid">
        <div class="component-box">
          <h3>Cardiovascular Health</h3>
          <p>The cardiovascular system (heart, blood vessels, and blood) benefits tremendously from regular exercise:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduces Risk of Heart Disease and Stroke</strong> - Regular exercise strengthens your heart muscle, making it more efficient at pumping blood. It also improves the health of your blood vessels, making them more flexible and less prone to blockages. Exercise helps prevent the buildup of plaque in arteries (atherosclerosis), which is a major cause of heart attacks and strokes. Studies show that physically active people have a 20-30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to inactive people. The benefits are dose-dependent, meaning more exercise (up to a point) provides greater protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Lowers Resting Blood Pressure and Improves Circulation</strong> - Regular aerobic exercise helps lower both systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure. This happens because exercise makes your heart stronger (so it doesn't have to work as hard), improves blood vessel elasticity, and helps your body better regulate blood pressure. Improved circulation means oxygen and nutrients are delivered more efficiently to all parts of your body, and waste products are removed more effectively. Better circulation also means your extremities (hands and feet) stay warmer and your skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Cholesterol Profile</strong> - Exercise has a positive effect on your blood lipids (fats). It increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein), which is the "good" cholesterol that helps remove LDL from your arteries. It also helps lower LDL (low-density lipoprotein), the "bad" cholesterol that can build up in arteries. Additionally, exercise can lower triglycerides (another type of fat in the blood). These changes reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The improvements in cholesterol are most significant with regular, moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Heart Function</strong> - Your heart becomes more efficient with regular exercise. It can pump more blood with each beat (increased stroke volume), so your resting heart rate decreases. A lower resting heart rate means your heart doesn't have to work as hard when you're at rest, which is a sign of good cardiovascular fitness. Your heart also recovers more quickly after exertion, which is another indicator of improved cardiovascular health.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="component-box">
          <h3>Musculoskeletal Health</h3>
          <p>Your muscles, bones, and joints all benefit from regular exercise:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengthens Muscles and Bones</strong> - Resistance training (weightlifting, bodyweight exercises) causes your muscles to adapt by becoming larger and stronger. This happens through a process where exercise creates microscopic tears in muscle fibers, which then repair and grow back stronger. For bones, weight-bearing exercise (walking, running, jumping, lifting weights) stimulates bone formation and increases bone density. This is crucial because bone density naturally decreases with age, and exercise can slow or even reverse this process. Strong muscles and bones make daily activities easier and reduce injury risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Balance, Coordination, and Flexibility</strong> - Regular exercise, especially activities that challenge balance and coordination (like yoga, tai chi, or balance training), improves your body's ability to maintain stability. This happens through improvements in proprioception (your body's sense of where it is in space) and strengthening of stabilizing muscles. Flexibility exercises improve the range of motion in your joints, which helps prevent injuries and improves performance in other activities. Better balance and coordination reduce your risk of falls, which is especially important as you age.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Risk of Osteoporosis and Falls</strong> - Weight-bearing exercise and resistance training are particularly effective at building and maintaining bone density. This is crucial for preventing osteoporosis, a condition where bones become weak and brittle. Exercise also strengthens the muscles that support your bones and improves balance, both of which help prevent falls. Falls are a major cause of fractures, especially in older adults, so improving balance and bone strength through exercise is a powerful preventive measure. Activities like walking, jogging, dancing, and weightlifting are all beneficial for bone health.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Joint Health</strong> - Regular movement helps keep joints healthy by promoting the production of synovial fluid (which lubricates joints) and strengthening the muscles that support joints. This is particularly important for people with arthritis, as appropriate exercise can reduce pain and improve function. Low-impact activities like swimming, cycling, and walking are especially joint-friendly while still providing health benefits.</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Improves mood and self-esteem through endorphin release</li>
        <li>Enhances sleep quality and stress resilience</li>

      <h2>Recommended Activity Guidelines</h2>
      <p>General guidelines for most adults (aim for at least):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, or 75 minutes/week of vigorous activity</li>
        <li>Plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days/week</li>
        <li>Include balance and flexibility exercises as needed</li>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Practical Tips to Get Started</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start small: short bouts (10–15 minutes) add up throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Choose activities you enjoy to improve adherence.</li>
        <li>Set realistic goals and track progress.</li>
        <li>Mix aerobic, strength, and flexibility training for balanced benefits.</li>
        <li>Consult a healthcare professional if you have chronic conditions or concerns.</li>
