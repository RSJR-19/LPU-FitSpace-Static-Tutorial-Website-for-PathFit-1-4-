        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
          <p>Physical fitness is the body's ability to perform daily tasks efficiently and effectively, without undue
            fatigue, and with enough energy left for leisure and emergency situations. It is not limited to sports or
            athletic performance—it is an essential part of overall wellness and quality of life.</p>

          <p>In the PathFit program, developing physical fitness means improving both health-related and skill-related
            capacities to promote lifelong movement competency and an active lifestyle.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Main Discussion -->
        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>What is Physical Fitness?</h2>
          <p>Physical fitness refers to a state of well-being in which an individual possesses sufficient energy and
            vitality to carry out everyday responsibilities and enjoy recreational pursuits. It reflects how efficiently
            the heart, lungs, muscles, and body systems work together.</p>

          <p>Researchers commonly classify physical fitness into two categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Health-Related Components – contribute directly to disease prevention and overall wellness.</li>
            <li>Skill-Related Components – enhance athletic ability and performance in physical activities.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Components of Physical Fitness -->
        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Components of Physical Fitness</h2>
          <p>Physical fitness is composed of multiple components that work together to create overall wellness.
            Understanding each component helps you develop a balanced fitness program that addresses all aspects of
            health and performance.</p>

          <div class="components-grid">
            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Health-Related Components</h3>
              <p>These components directly impact your health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. They are
                essential for everyone, regardless of athletic ability.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardiovascular Endurance</strong> - This is the ability of your heart, lungs, and
                  circulatory system to deliver oxygen-rich blood to working muscles during sustained physical activity.
                  When you have good cardiovascular endurance, you can perform activities like running, swimming, or
                  cycling for extended periods without becoming excessively tired. Your heart becomes stronger and more
                  efficient, pumping more blood with each beat. This reduces your risk of heart disease, stroke, and
                  high blood pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Muscular Strength</strong> - This refers to the maximum amount of force a muscle or muscle
                  group can generate in a single maximal effort. For example, how much weight you can lift once (your
                  one-rep max) or how hard you can push against resistance. Building muscular strength helps you perform
                  daily tasks more easily, prevents injuries, improves bone density, and increases your metabolism.
                  Activities like weightlifting, resistance training, and bodyweight exercises develop this component.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Muscular Endurance</strong> - Unlike strength (which is about maximum force), endurance is
                  the ability of muscles to perform repeated contractions or sustain a contraction over time without
                  fatigue. For instance, how many push-ups you can do or how long you can hold a plank position. Good
                  muscular endurance allows you to perform repetitive tasks without getting tired quickly, which is
                  important for both daily activities and sports performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - This is the range of motion available at a joint or group of joints.
                  It determines how far you can stretch or move your body parts. Good flexibility helps prevent
                  injuries, improves posture, reduces muscle tension, and enhances performance in physical activities.
                  Flexibility can be improved through regular stretching exercises, yoga, and activities that take
                  joints through their full range of motion.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Composition</strong> - This refers to the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass (muscle,
                  bone, organs, water) in your body. It's not just about weight, but about what your body is made of. A
                  healthy body composition means having an appropriate amount of body fat relative to lean tissue. This
                  is important because excess body fat increases the risk of various health problems, while adequate
                  muscle mass supports metabolism and functional capacity.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="component-box">
              <h3>Skill-Related Components</h3>
              <p>These components enhance your ability to perform in sports and physical activities. While not directly
                related to health, they improve your athletic performance and movement quality.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Agility</strong> - This is the ability to change direction quickly and efficiently while
                  maintaining control of your body. It combines speed, balance, coordination, and reaction time. Agility
                  is crucial in sports like basketball, soccer, and tennis where you need to quickly change direction to
                  avoid opponents or respond to game situations. Agility training involves drills that require rapid
                  directional changes, such as ladder drills, cone drills, and shuttle runs.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance</strong> - This is the ability to maintain your body's equilibrium (stability)
                  whether you're stationary (static balance) or moving (dynamic balance). Good balance prevents falls,
                  improves coordination, and is essential for activities like gymnastics, martial arts, and even
                  everyday tasks like walking on uneven surfaces. Balance can be improved through exercises like
                  standing on one leg, using balance boards, or practicing yoga poses.</li>
                <li><strong>Coordination</strong> - This is the ability to use different parts of your body together
                  smoothly and efficiently to perform movements. It involves the integration of your senses (especially
                  vision and proprioception) with your muscles and nervous system. Good coordination allows you to
                  perform complex movements like dribbling a basketball while running, or hitting a tennis ball.
                  Activities that improve coordination include dancing, martial arts, and sports that require hand-eye
                  or foot-eye coordination.</li>
                <li><strong>Power</strong> - This is the combination of strength and speed - the ability to exert
                  maximum force in the shortest amount of time. Power is what allows you to jump high, sprint fast, or
                  throw an object far. It's different from strength alone because it requires both force production and
                  speed of movement. Power training involves explosive movements like plyometrics, Olympic lifts, and
                  sprinting.</li>
                <li><strong>Reaction Time</strong> - This is the time it takes you to respond to a stimulus. In sports,
                  this might be reacting to a starting gun, a ball coming toward you, or an opponent's movement. Good
                  reaction time can be the difference between success and failure in many activities. Reaction time can
                  be improved through specific drills that require quick responses to visual, auditory, or tactile cues.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Speed</strong> - This is the ability to move your body or parts of your body rapidly from
                  one point to another. Speed is important in many sports and activities, from sprinting to quickly
                  moving your hands in volleyball. Speed training involves practicing movements at high velocity, sprint
                  drills, and exercises that improve the rate of muscle contraction.</li>

          <h2>Health Benefits of Physical Fitness</h2>
          <p>Regular participation in physical activities has wide-ranging effects on the human body and mind. The
            benefits extend far beyond just looking good - they impact every system in your body and improve your
            quality of life in numerous ways.</p>

          <div class="image-placeholder">
            <div class="image-placeholder-icon"></div>
            <div class="image-placeholder-text">Health Benefits Infographic</div>
          </div>

          <div class="takeaways-box">
            <h3>Physical Health Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Strengthens the Heart, Lungs, and Muscular System</strong> - Regular exercise makes your heart
                muscle stronger, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently with less effort. Your resting heart rate
                decreases, meaning your heart doesn't have to work as hard when you're at rest. Your lungs become more
                efficient at taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. Your muscles become stronger and more toned,
                which helps with daily activities and prevents age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).</li>
              <li><strong>Helps Maintain Healthy Weight and Body Composition</strong> - Physical activity burns calories
                and helps create a calorie deficit when combined with proper nutrition. It also increases your
                metabolism, even after you finish exercising (this is called the "afterburn effect" or excess
                post-exercise oxygen consumption). Regular exercise helps build and maintain muscle mass, which burns
                more calories at rest than fat tissue does. This makes it easier to maintain a healthy weight long-term.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Reduces Risk of Non-Communicable Diseases</strong> - Regular physical activity significantly
                lowers your risk of developing chronic diseases such as:
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px;">
                  <li>Type 2 Diabetes - Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, helping your body use glucose more
                    effectively</li>
                  <li>Cardiovascular Disease - Strengthens the heart and improves circulation, reducing risk of heart
                    attack and stroke</li>
                  <li>Certain Cancers - Studies show regular exercise reduces risk of colon, breast, and other cancers
                  </li>
                  <li>Osteoporosis - Weight-bearing exercise strengthens bones and reduces risk of fractures</li>
                  <li>High Blood Pressure - Regular activity helps maintain healthy blood pressure levels</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mental and Emotional Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Improves Mental Health and Reduces Stress</strong> - Exercise triggers the release of
                endorphins, which are natural mood elevators often called "feel-good" chemicals. It also reduces levels
                of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Regular physical activity has been shown to be as
                effective as medication for treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety. It improves sleep quality,
                which further enhances mental well-being.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhances Self-Esteem, Focus, and Academic Performance</strong> - Achieving fitness goals
                builds confidence and self-esteem. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which improves cognitive
                function, memory, and concentration. Studies consistently show that students who are physically active
                perform better academically. Physical activity also helps with attention span and reduces symptoms of
                ADHD.</li>
              <li><strong>Promotes Social Interaction and Teamwork</strong> - Participating in group activities, sports,
                or fitness classes provides opportunities to meet new people, build friendships, and develop social
                skills. Team sports teach cooperation, communication, and leadership. These social connections
                contribute to overall happiness and provide a support system that can help you maintain your fitness
                routine.</li>

            <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adults should engage in
              at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75–150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity
              each week for optimal health. Additionally, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed on 2 or
              more days per week. This doesn't have to be done all at once - even 10-minute bouts of activity throughout
              the day count toward your weekly goal!</p>
